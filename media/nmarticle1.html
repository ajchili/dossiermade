<p>Gender inequality is a topic that always seems to make its way into a conversation. Why? Simple, it’s important, especially when it comes to the music scene; which has long been dominated by the male gender. This year however, women are kicking down barriers and proving that they shouldn’t be overlooked or underrated.</p>
<p>And there’s one artist in particular that is doing this especially well.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/1cmsib6hstj391i/image1.jpg?raw=1" alt=""></p>
<p>With her mix <strong>“Pussy Power Mix 2”</strong> taking off and landing on sites like Papermag and Saint Heron, DylantheGypsy the self-proclaimed “artist, dj, food lover, fashion enthusiast and puppy obsessor” is making big waves on the scene as a New York-based DJ. I was fortune enough to speak with her and although neither of our schedules allowed us to meet in person I was able to divulge some of who DylantheGypsy is and ask the crucial questions via email.</p>
<p>She began dj’ing the summer of 2014 as her own way of gaining independence and living on her own.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I brainstormed on things I’m good at that simultaneously make me happy and don’t compromise who I am morally and realized I had always wanted to DJ. I reached out to my friend Ant (DJ Marauder) and he gave me my first Hercules dj controller. About a month later my dad bought me a Serato controller and software and the rest is history from there…I made my first mix when I wasn’t confident in myself and my bando soul when I wanted to push myself and step out of my comfort zone.”</p>

<p>DylantheGypsy has been hitting the music scene hard, featuring on the “We Buy Gold” tour alongside DonMonique as well as dj’ing her first Boiler Room solo. She described both experiences as surreal childhood dreams that she was blessed to see materialized.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“…To think that I’d be djing for them this early in my career is a blessing alone. Also a blessing that my first time attending a Boiler Room set was for a gig which is even better”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>she says, adding</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“As far as Santigold, I am a completely different person after that tour and I mean it in the best way possible. She is a force to be reckoned with. I admire her passion, work ethic, and professionalism so much…And I loved djing for DonMonique. We grew a lot from being on the road. We learned from our best (and worst) performances and kept feeding off of each other’s energy and developed a really solid performance by the end of the tour.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But being a woman in a male dominated business is not always easy, as Dylan talks about using her femininity to influence and inspire her.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I think it’s always  subjective to the individual, but I see girl power as 100% positivity and self-love/acceptance of every good and bad thing that makes you a woman.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/icwixkjrshf3gdl/image2.jpg?raw=1" alt=""></p>
<p>Although she does acknowledge that there aren’t that many differences between her career and that of a male.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A lot of my male dj peers who patronized me when I first started out are finally starting to take me seriously. I also notice men get surprised at the amount of trap music I include in my sets as if it were exclusive to them. It’s pretty funny to see the reactions/ respect I get after my set vs. the mansplaining and condescending behavior they convey before I dj.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now having checked Boiler Room off her list next is Trillectro and possibly dj’ing overseas before the year ends. To other young women striving to pave their  way and make their mark she says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“know your worth, be patient with your success, and it’s okay to come off as a bitch if it means your money and respect are being taken care of. I am naturally a pacifist, I HATE conflict and confrontation. It makes me really uncomfortable. But since I started djing and running my own business now with my friends, I had to step out of my comfort zone and really put on my big-girl panties because people are always taking advantage of me and my passiveness.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aside from just music, DylantheGypsy is a member of</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“…an art collective comprised of eight multifaceted members  ranging in talents from filmmaking, illustration, make up, photography, and dj’ing…to create a platform to showcase our work and personalities. We were tired of being slept on and wanted to take initiative and put ourselves on. We also created a charity portion of our collective. Through our event proceeds, we aim on helping artists in need who can’t afford to survive and still fund their own careers…Paint brushes, easels, camera lenses, instruments, music production software, etc. It gets very expensive. Artists also tend to receive less support than those pursuing careers like law and medicine. Anyone interested in participating in our events or receiving help just has to email us with what they need and we will work our hardest to try and accommodate.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everything is still in the beginning stages of this organization, as they currently strive to gain sponsors to help supply donations, proceeds, supplies and resources.</p>
<p>As the interview came to a close, DylantheGypsy revealed that aside from her own mixes, this year her three favorite drops have been Beyonce’s “Lemonade”, Young Thug’s “Slime Season 3” and James Blake’s “The Color in Anything” While “Si J’etais un home” by Diane Tell is one of her “favorite songs ever” and always brings her back to her childhood. It’s no surprise that with her attitude, musical abilities and faith DylantheGypsy will be going far, and we can’t wait to see what’s in store.</p>
